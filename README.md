Requisites
----------

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) (>= v4)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com)
- The following executables should be correctly installed in your shell environment:
  - `ssh`: Any recent version of the OpenSSH ssh client (required by `resin sync` and `resin ssh`)
	- if you need `ssh` to work behind the proxy you also need [`proxytunnel`](http://proxytunnel.sourceforge.net/) installed (available as `proxytunnel` package for Ubuntu, for example)
  - `rsync`: >= 2.6.9 (required by `resin sync`)

##### Windows Support

Before installing resin-cli, you'll need a working node-gyp environment. If you don't already have one you'll see native module build errors during installation. To fix this, run `npm install -g --production windows-build-tools` in an administrator console (available as 'Command Prompt (Admin)' when pressing windows+x in Windows 7+).

`resin sync` and `resin ssh` have not been thoroughly tested on the standard Windows cmd.exe shell. We recommend using bash (or a similar) shell, like Bash for Windows 10 or [Git for Windows](https://git-for-windows.github.io/).

If you still want to use `cmd.exe` you will have to use a package manager like MinGW or chocolatey. For MinGW the steps are:

1. Install [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org).
2. Install the `msys-rsync` and `msys-openssh` packages.
3. Add MinGW to the `%PATH%` if this hasn't been done by the installer already. The location where the binaries are places is usually `C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\bin`, but it can vary if you selected a different location in the installer.
4. Copy your SSH keys to `%homedrive%%homepath\.ssh`.
5. If you need `ssh` to work behind the proxy you also need to install [proxytunnel](http://proxytunnel.sourceforge.net/)

Getting Started
---------------

### Install

This might require elevated privileges in some environments.

```sh
$ npm install --global --production resin-cli
```

### Login

```sh
$ resin login
```

_(Typically useful, but not strictly required for all commands)_

### Run commands

Take a look at the full command documentation at [https://docs.resin.io/tools/cli/](https://docs.resin.io/tools/cli/#table-of-contents
), or by running `resin help`.

FAQ
---

### Where is my configuration file?

The per-user configuration file lives in `$HOME/.resinrc.yml` or `%UserProfile%\_resinrc.yml`, in Unix based operating systems and Windows respectively.

The Resin CLI also attempts to read a `resinrc.yml` file in the current directory, which takes precedence over the per-user configuration file.

### How do I point the Resin CLI to staging?

The easiest way is to set the `RESINRC_RESIN_URL=resinstaging.io` environment variable.

Alternatively, you can edit your configuration file and set `resinUrl: resinstaging.io` to persist this setting.

### How do I make the Resin CLI persist data in another directory?

The Resin CLI persists your session token, as well as cached images in `$HOME/.resin` or `%UserProfile%\_resin`.

Pointing the Resin CLI to persist data in another location is necessary in certain environments, like a server, where there is no home directory, or a device running resinOS, which erases all data after a restart.

You can accomplish this by setting `RESINRC_DATA_DIRECTORY=/opt/resin` or adding `dataDirectory: /opt/resin` to your configuration file, replacing `/opt/resin` with your desired directory.
